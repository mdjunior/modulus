# modulus

Modulus is a simple game for an experiment involving learning machines. In this game we have a referee who controls the existing games (in memory) and interfaces with the players (who need to send a "value" to enter a game).

A simple example of a player is provided, but the idea is that you can use your favorite machine learning framework to play the role of the player and thus test one algorithm against another.

Once the game is over, the plays provided by the players are revealed, so your algorithm can check what went wrong.
Good luck!
